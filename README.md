# PUFAnalytics
 PUFAnalytics is a Python-based toolkit designed for comprehensive evaluation and analysis of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). This repository provides implementations for calculating critical PUF metrics including Intra-PUF Variation, Inter-PUF Variation, Uniqueness, Reliability, Avalanche Effect, and Uniformity. These metrics are essential for assessing the performance, security, and robustness of PUF instances under varying conditions. Whether you're conducting academic research or developing secure hardware, PUFAnalytics offers a reliable and scientifically accurate way to measure PUF characteristics.

## Key Features

- **Intra-PUF Variation**: Measures the variation in the same PUF's response under different conditions.
- **Inter-PUF Variation**: Measures the difference between different PUF instances' responses.
- **Uniqueness**: Determines how distinct responses are across different PUF instances.
- **Reliability**: Evaluates the consistency of a PUF's response under varied conditions.
- **Avalanche Effect**: Assesses the sensitivity of the PUF to changes in input challenges.
- **Uniformity**: Measures the balance of 1s and 0s in a single PUF response.
